# Over-Reaction
This repo contains personal projects and notes for learning Typescript with React. 

## Typescript
Typescript is a superset of Javascript that adds static typing to help prevent coding mistakes. 

## Getting Setup
Start by installing Node.js and npm. The Node Package Manager (npm) is bundled with Node.js and can be installed from the official website.
Next, I installed typescript with:
```shell
npm install -g typescript
```
I install version v22.13.0 of Node and 11.0.0 of npm.
